# js-treemap

JavaScript code to draw treemaps.

At the moment only non-hierarchical treemaps can be drawn. To use it, see the index.html file.

The implemented algorithm is based on the publication [Squarified Treemaps](http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/stm.pdf) by Mark Bruls, Kees Huizing, and Jarke J. van Wijk.
