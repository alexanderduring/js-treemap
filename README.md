# js-treemap

JavaScript code to draw treemaps.

At the moment only non-hierarchical treemaps can be drawn. For a demo: Clone the repository and open demo/index.html in your web browser.

The implemented algorithm is based on the publication [Squarified Treemaps](http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/stm.pdf) by Mark Bruls, Kees Huizing, and Jarke J. van Wijk.
